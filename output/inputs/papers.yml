- abstract: Misogyny meme detection is identifying memes that are harmful or offensive
    to women. These memes can hide hate behind jokes or images, making them difficult
    to identify. It's important to detect them for a safer and respectful internet
    for everyone. Our model proposed a multimodal method for misogyny meme detection
    in Chinese social media by combining both textual and visual aspects of memes.
    The training and evaluation data were part of a shared task on detecting misogynistic
    content.  We used a pretrained ResNet-50 architecture to extract visual representations
    of the memes and processed the meme transcriptions with BERT. The model fused
    modality-specific representations with a feed-forward neural net for classification.
    The selected pretrained models were frozen to avoid overfitting and to enhance
    generalization across all classes, and only the final classifier was fine-tuned
    on labelled meme recollection. The model was trained and evaluated using test
    data to achieve a macro F1-score of 0.70345. As a result, we have validated lightweight
    combining approaches for multimodal fusion techniques on noisy social media and
    how they can be validated in the context of hostile meme detection tasks.

  title: SSNCSE@LT-EDI-2025:Detecting Misogyny Memes using Pretrained Deep Learning
    models
- abstract: Speech recognition is a helpful tool for accessing technology and allowing
    people to interact with technology naturally. This is especially true for people
    who want to access technology but may encounter challenges interacting with technology
    in traditional formats. Some examples of these people include the elderly or people
    from the transgender community. This research presents an Automatic Speech Recognition
    (ASR) system developed for Tamil-speaking elderly and transgender people who are
    generally underrepresented in mainstream ASR training datasets. The proposed work
    used the speech data shared by the task organisers of LT-EDI2025. In the proposed
    work used the fine-tuned model of OpenAI's Whisper model with Parameter-Efficient
    Fine-Tuning (P-EFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) along with SpecAugment, and
    used the AdamW optimization method. The model's work led to an overall Word Error
    Rate (WER) of 42.3\% on the untranscribed test data. A key feature of our work
    is that it demonstrates potential equitable and accessible ASR systems addressing
    the linguistic and acoustic features of vulnerable groups.

  title: 'JUNLP@LT-EDI-2025: Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation of Whisper for Inclusive
    Tamil Speech Recognition Targeting Vulnerable Populations'
- abstract: This paper presents a description of the paper submitted to the Shared
    Task on Homophobia and Transphobia Detection in Social Media Comments, LT-EDI
    at LDK 2025. We propose a hybrid approach to detect homophobic and transphobic
    content in low-resource languages using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
    (TF-IDF) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for
    contextual embeddings. The TF-IDF helps capture the token's importance, whereas
    BERT generates contextualized embeddings. This hybridization subsequently generates
    an embedding that contains statistical surface-level patterns and deep semantic
    understanding. The system uses principal component analysis (PCA) and a random
    forest classifier. The application of PCA converts a sparse, very high-dimensional
    embedding into a dense representation by keeping only the most relevant features.
    The model achieved robust performance across eight Indian languages, with the
    highest accuracy in Hindi. However, lower performance in Marathi highlights challenges
    in low-resource settings. Combining TF-IDF and BERT embeddings leads to better
    classification results, showing the benefits of integrating simple and complex
    language models. Limitations include potential feature redundancy and poor performance
    in languages with complex word forms, indicating a need for future adjustments
    to support multiple languages and address imbalances.

  title: 'SKVtrio@LT-EDI-2025: Hybrid TF-IDF and BERT Embeddings for  Multilingual
    Homophobia and Transphobia Detection in Social Media  Comments'
- abstract: 'The proliferation of racial hoaxes that associate individuals or groups
    with fabricated crimes or incidents presents unique challenges in multilingual
    social media contexts. This paper introduces BaCoHoax, a novel framework for detecting
    race-based misinformation in code-mixed content. We address this problem by participating
    in the "Shared Task Detecting Racial Hoaxes in Code-Mixed Hindi-English Social
    Media Data: LT-EDI@LDK 2025."  BaCoHoax is a bias-aware detection system built
    on a DeBERTa-based architecture, enhanced with disentangled attention mechanisms,
    a dynamic bias discovery module that adapts to emerging narrative patterns, and
    an adaptive contrastive learning objective.  We evaluated BaCoHoax on the HoaxMixPlus
    corpus, a collection of 5,105 YouTube comments annotated for racial hoaxes, achieved
    a competitive macro F1 score of 0.67 and securing 7th place among participating
    teams in the shared task.

    Our findings contribute to the growing field of multilingual misinformation detection
    and highlight the importance of culturally informed approaches to identifying
    harmful content in linguistically diverse online spaces.'

- abstract: "Online platforms have enabled users to create and share multimodal content,\
    \ fostering new forms of personal expression and cultural interaction. Among these,\
    \ memes\u2014combinations of images and text\u2014have become a prevalent mode\

    \ In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of various multimodal models\

  title: CVF-NITT@LT-EDI-2025:MisogynyDetection
- abstract: Detecting hate speech targeting caste and migration communities in code-mixed
    Tamil-English social media content is challenging due to limited resources and
    socio-cultural complexities. This paper proposes a multi-scale hybrid architecture
    combining classical and neural representations with hierarchical ensemble learning.
    We employ advanced preprocessing including transliteration and character repetition
    removal, then extract features using classical TF-IDF vectors at multiple scales
    (512, 1024, 2048) processed through linear layers, alongside contextual embeddings
    from five transformer models-Google BERT, XLM-RoBERTa (Base and Large), SeanBenhur
    BERT, and IndicBERT. These concatenated representations encode both statistical
    and contextual information, which are input to multiple ML classification heads
    (Random Forest, SVM, etc). A three-level hierarchical ensemble strategy combines
    predictions across classifiers, transformer-TF-IDF combinations, and dimensional
    scales for enhanced robustness. Our method scored an F1-score of 0.818, ranking
    3rd in the LT-EDI-2025 shared task, showing the efficacy of blending classical
    and neural methods with multi-level ensemble learning for hate speech detection
    in low-resource languages.

  title: 'Wise@LT-EDI-2025: Combining Classical and Neural Representations with Multi-scale
    Ensemble Learning for Code-mixed Hate Speech Detection'
- abstract: False narratives that manipulate racial tensions are increasingly prevalent
    on social media, often blending languages and cultural references to enhance reach
    and believability.  Among them, racial hoaxes produce unique harm by fabricating
    events targeting specific communities, social division and fueling misinformation.
    This paper presents a novel approach to detecting racial hoaxes in code-mixed
    Hindi-English social media data. Using a carefully constructed training pipeline,
    we have fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa-base multilingual transformer for training
    the shared task data. Our approach has incorporated task-specific preprocessing,
    clear methodology, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. After developing our model,
    we tested and evaluated it on the LT-EDI@LDK 2025 shared task dataset. Our system
    achieved the highest performance among all the international participants with
    an F1-score of 0.75, ranking 1st on the official leaderboard.

  title: 'CUET''s\_White\_Walkers@LT-EDI 2025: Racial Hoax Detection in Code-Mixed
    on Social Media Data'
- abstract: Memes, combining visual and textual elements, have emerged as a prominent
    medium for both expression and the spread of harmful ideologies, including misogyny.
    To address this issue in Chinese online content, we present a multimodal framework
    for misogyny meme detection as part of the LT-EDI@LDK 2025 Shared Task. Our study
    investigates a range of machine learning (ML) methods such as Logistic Regression,
    Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests, as well as deep learning (DL) architectures
    including CNNs and hybrid models like BiLSTM-CNN and CNN-GRU for extracting textual
    features. On the transformer side, we explored multiple pretrained models including
    mBERT, MuRIL, and BERT- base-chinese to capture nuanced language representations.
    These textual models were fused with visual features extracted from pretrained
    ResNet50 and DenseNet121 architectures using both early and decision-level fusion
    strategies. Among all evaluated configurations, the BERT-base-chinese + ResNet50
    early fusion model achieved the best overall performance, with a macro F1-score
    of 0.8541, ranking 4th in the shared task. These findings underscore the effectiveness
    of combining pretrained vision and language models for tackling multimodal hate
    speech detection.

  title: 'CUET''s\_White\_Walkers@LT-EDI-2025: A Multimodal Framework for the Detection
    of Misogynistic Memes in Chinese Online Content'
- abstract: Hate speech on social media is an evolving problem, particularly in low-resource
    languages like Tamil, where traditional hate speech detection approaches remain
    under developed. In this work, we provide a focused solution for cast and migration-based
    hate speech detection using Tamil-BERT, a Tamil-specialized pre-trained transformer
    model. One of the key challenges in hate speech detection is the severe class
    imbalance in the dataset, with hate speech being the minority class. We solve
    this using focal loss, a loss function that gives more importance to harder-to-classify
    examples, improving the performance of the model in detecting minority classes.
    We train our model on a publicly available labeled dataset of Tamil text as hate
    and non-hate speech. Under strict evaluation, our approach achieves impressive
    results, outperforming baseline models by a considerable margin. The model achieves
    an F1 score of 0.8634 and good precision, recall, and accuracy, making it a robust
    solution for hate speech detection in Tamil. The results show that fine-tuning
    transformer-based models like Tamil-BERT, coupled with techniques like focal loss,
    can substantially improve performance in hate speech detection for low-resource
    languages. This work is a contribution to this growing amount of research and
    provides insights on how to tackle class imbalance for NLP tasks.

  title: 'CUET''s\_White\_Walkers@LT-EDI 2025: Transformer-Based Model for the Detection
    of Caste and Migration Hate Speech'
- abstract: Hate speech directed at caste and migrant communities is a widespread
    problem on social media, frequently taking the form of insults specific to a given
    region, coded language, and disparaging slurs. This type of abuse seriously jeopardizes
    both individual well-being and social harmony in addition to perpetuating discrimination.
    In order to promote safer and more inclusive digital environments, it is imperative
    that this challenge be addressed. However, linguistic subtleties, code-mixing,
    and the lack of extensive annotated datasets make it difficult to detect such
    hate speech in Indian languages like Tamil. We suggest a supervised machine learning
    system that uses FastText embeddings specifically designed for Tamil-language
    content and Whisper-based speech recognition to address these issues. This strategy
    aims to precisely identify hate speech connected to caste and migration, supporting
    the larger endeavor to reduce online abuse in low resource languages like Tamil.

  title: 'SSN\_IT\_HATE@LT-EDI-2025: Caste and Migration Hate Speech Detection'
- abstract: Caste and migration hate speech detection is a critical task in the context
    of increasingly multilingual and diverse online discourse. In this work, we address
    the problem of identifying hate speech targeting caste and migrant communities
    across a multilingual social media dataset containing Tamil, Tamil written in
    English script, and English. We explore and compare different feature representations,
    including TF-IDF vectors and embeddings from pretrained transformer-based models,
    to train various machine learning classifiers. Our experiments show that a Soft
    Voting Classifier that make use of both TF-IDF vectors and MuRIL embeddings performs
    best, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.802 on the test set. This approach was evaluated
    as part of the Shared Task on Caste and Migration Hate Speech Detection at LT-EDI@LDK
    2025, where it ranked 6th overall.

  title: 'ItsAllGoodMan@LT-EDI-2025: Fusing TF-IDF and MuRIL Embeddings for Detecting
    Caste and Migration Hate Speech'
- abstract: 'Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology can potentially make marginalized
    communities more accessible. However, older adults

    and transgender speakers are usually highly disadvantaged in accessing valuable
    services due to low digital literacy and social biases. In Tamil-speaking regions,
    these are further compounded by the inability of ASR models to address their unique
    speech types, accents, and spontaneous speaking styles. To bridge this gap, the
    LT-EDI-2025 shared task is designed to develop robust ASR systems for Tamil speech
    from vulnerable populations. Using whisper based models, this task is designed
    to improve recognition rates in speech data collected from older adults and transgender
    speakers in naturalistic settings such as banks, hospitals and public offices.
    By bridging the linguistic heterogeneity and acoustic variability among this underrepresented
    population, the shared task is designed to develop inclusive AI solutions that
    break communication barriers and empower vulnerable populations in Tamil Nadu.'

  title: NSR\_LT-EDI-2025 Automatic speech recognition in Tamil
- abstract: Hate speech detection in low-resource languages such as Tamil presents
    significant challenges due to linguistic complexity, limited annotated data, and
    the sociocultural sensitivity of the subject matter. This study focuses on identifying
    caste- and migration-related hate speech in Tamil social media texts, as part
    of the LT-EDI@LDK 2025 Shared Task. The dataset used consists of 5,512 training
    instances and 787 development instances, annotated for binary classification into
    caste/migration-related and non-caste/migration-related hate speech. We employ
    a range of models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNN), and transformer-based architectures such as BERT and multilingual
    BERT (mBERT). A central focus of this work is evaluating model performance using
    macro F1-score, which provides a balanced assessment across this imbalanced dataset.
    Experimental results demonstrate that transformer-based models, particularly mBERT,
    significantly outperform traditional approaches by effectively capturing the contextual
    and implicit nature of hate speech. This research underscores the importance of
    culturally informed NLP solutions for fostering safer online environments in underrepresented
    linguistic communities such as Tamil.

  title: 'Solvers@LT-EDI-2025: Caste and Migration Hate Speech Detection in Tamil-English
    Code-Mixed Text'
- abstract: 'Language that criticizes threatens, or discriminates against people or
    groups because of their caste, social rank, or status is known as caste and migration
    hate speech and it has grown in credibly common on social media. Such speech not
    only contributes to social disruption and in equity, but it also puts at risk
    the safety and mental health of the targeted groups. Due to the absence of labeled
    data, the subtlety of culturally unique insults, and the lack of strong linguistic
    resources for deep text recognition, it is especially difficult to detect caste
    and migration hate speech in low-resource Dravidian languages like Tamil. In this
    work, we address the Caste and Migration Hate Speech Detection task, aiming to
    automatically classify user-generated content as either hateful or non-hateful.
    We evaluate a range of approaches, including a traditional TF-IDF-based machine
    learning pipeline using SVM and Logistic Regression, alongside five transformer-based
    models: mBERT, XLM-R, MuRIL, Tamil BERT, and Tamilhate-BERT.Among these, the domain-adapted
    Tamilhate BERT achieved the highest macro-F1 score of 0.88 on the test data, securing
    1st place in the Shared Task on Caste and Migration Hate Speech Detection at DravidianLangTech@LT-EDI
    2025. Our findings highlight the strong performance of transformer models, particularly
    those fine-tuned on domain-specific data, in detecting nuanced hate speech in
    low-resource, code-mixed languages like Tamil.'

  title: 'KEC-Elite-Analysts@LT-EDI 2025: Leveraging Deep Learning for Racial Hoax
    Detection in Code-Mixed Hindi-English Tweets'
- abstract: Memes, originally crafted for humor or cultural commentary, have evolved
    into powerful tools for spreading harmful content, particularly misogynistic ideologies.
    These memes sustain damaging gender stereotypes, further entrenching social inequality
    and encouraging toxic behavior across online platforms. While progress has been
    made in detecting harmful memes in English, identifying misogynistic content in
    Chinese remains challenging due to the language's complexities and cultural subtleties.
    The multimodal nature of memes, combining text and images, adds to the detection
    difficulty. In the LT-EDI@LDK 2025 Shared Task on Misogyny Meme Detection, we
    have focused on analyzing both text and image elements to identify misogynistic
    content in Chinese memes. For text-based models, we have experimented with Chinese
    BERT, XLM-RoBERTa and DistilBERT, with Chinese BERT yielding the highest performance,
    achieving an F1 score of 0.86. In terms of image models, VGG16 outperformed ResNet
    and ViT, also achieving an F1 score of 0.85. Among all model combinations, the
    integration of Chinese BERT with VGG16 emerged as the most impactful, delivering
    superior performance,  highlighting the benefit of a multimodal approach. By exploiting
    these two modalities, our model has effectively captured the subtle details present
    in memes, improving its ability to accurately detect misogynistic content. This
    approach has resulted in a macro F1 score of 0.90355, securing 3rd rank in the
    task.

  title: 'Team\_Luminaries\_0227@LT-EDI-2025: A Transformer-Based Fusion Approach
    to Misogyny Detection in Chinese Memes'
- abstract: This paper presents our system for the detection of racial hoaxes in code-mixed
    Hindi-English social media narratives, which is in reality a form of debunking
    of online disinformation claiming fake incidents against a racial group. We experiment
    with different modeling techniques on HoaxMixPlus dataset of 5,102 annotated YouTube
    comments. In our approach, we utilize traditional machine learning classifiers
    (SVM, LR, RF), deep learning models (CNN, CNN-LSTM, CNN-BiLSTM), and transformer-based
    architectures (MuRIL, XLM-RoBERTa, HingRoBERTa-mixed). Experiments show that transformer-based
    methods substantially outperform traditional approaches, and the HingRoBERTa-mixed
    model is the best one with an F1 score of 0.7505. An error analysis identifies
    the difficulty of recognizing implicit bias and nuanced contexts in complex hoaxes.
    Our team was 5th place in the challenge with an F1 score of 0.69. This work contributes
    to combating online misinformation in low-resource linguistic environments and
    highlights the effectiveness of specialized language models for code-mixed content.

  title: 'Hinterwelt@LT-EDI 2025: A Transformer-Based Approach for Identifying Racial
    Hoaxes in Code-Mixed Hindi-English Social Media Narratives'
- abstract: Misogynistic memes spread harmful stereotypes and toxic content across
    social media platforms, often combining sarcastic text and offensive visuals that
    make them difficult to detect using traditional methods. Our research has been
    part of the the Shared Task on Misogyny Meme Detection - LT- EDI@LDK 2025, identifying
    misogynistic memes using deep learning-based multimodal approach that leverages
    both textual and visual information for accurate classification of such memes.
    We experiment with various models including CharBERT, BiLSTM, and CLIP for text
    and image encoding, and explore fusion strategies like early and gated fusion.
    Our best performing model, CharBERT + BiLSTM + CLIP with gated fusion, achieves
    strong results, showing the effectiveness of combining features from both modalities.
    To address challenges like language mixing and class imbalance, we apply preprocessing
    techniques (e.g., Romanizing Chinese text) and data augmentation (e.g., image
    transformations, text back-translation). The results demonstrate significant improvements
    over unimodal baselines, highlighting the value of multimodal learning in detecting
    subtle and harmful content online.

  title: 'CUET\_12033@LT-EDI-2025: Misogyny Detection'
- abstract: 'The rapid growth of the internet and social media has given people an
    open space to share their opinions, but it has also led to a rise in hate speech
    targeting different social, cultural, and political groups. While much of the
    research on hate speech detection has focused on widely spoken languages, languages
    like Tamil, which are less commonly studied, still face significant gaps in this
    area. To tackle this, the Shared Task on Caste and Migration Hate Speech Detection
    was organized at the Fifth Workshop on Language Technology for Equality, Diversity,
    and Inclusion (LT-EDI-2025). This paper aims to create an automatic system that
    can detect caste and migration-related hate speech in Tamil-language social media
    content. We broke down our approach into two phases: in the first phase, we tested
    seven machine learning models and five transformer-based models. In the second
    phase, we combined the predictions from the fine-tuned transformers using a majority
    voting technique. This ensemble approach outperformed all other models, achieving
    the highest macro F1 score of 0.81682, which earned us 4th place in the competition.'

  title: 'CUET\_Blitz\_Aces@LT-EDI-2025: Leveraging Transformer Ensembles and Majority
    Voting for Hate Speech Detection'
- abstract: This paper presents our system for detecting caste and migration-related
    hate speech in Tamil social media comments, addressing the challenges in this
    low-resource language setting. We experimented with multiple approaches on a dataset
    of 7,875 annotated comments. Our methodology encompasses traditional machine learning
    classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, KNN), deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM),
    and transformer-based architectures (MuRIL, IndicBERT, XLM-RoBERTa). Comprehensive
    evaluations demonstrate that transformer-based models substantially outperform
    traditional approaches, with MuRIL-large achieving the highest performance with
    a macro F1 score of 0.8092. Error analysis reveals challenges in detecting implicit
    and culturally-specific hate speech expressions requiring deeper socio-cultural
    context. Our team ranked 5th in the LT-EDI@LDK 2025 shared task with an F1 score
    of 0.80916. This work contributes to combating harmful online content in low-resource
    languages and highlights the effectiveness of large pre-trained multilingual models
    for nuanced text classification tasks.

  title: 'Hinterwelt@LT-EDI 2025: A Transformer-Based Detection of Caste and Migration
    Hate Speech in Tamil Social Media'
- abstract: Social media platforms and user-generated content, such as tweets, comments,
    and blog posts often contain offensive language, including racial hate speech,
    personal attacks, and sexual harassment. Detecting such inappropriate language
    is essential to ensure user safety and to prevent the spread of hateful behavior
    and online aggression. Approaches base on conventional machine learning and deep
    learning have shown robust results for high-resource languages like English and
    find it hard to deal with code-mixed text, which is common in bilingual communication.
    We participated in the shared task "LT-EDI@LDK 2025" organized by DravidianLangTech,
    applying the BERT-base multilingual cased model and achieving an F1 score of 0.63.
    These results demonstrate how our model effectively processes and interprets the
    unique linguistic features of code-mixed content. The source code is available
    on GitHub.1

    Code-Mixed Social Media Texts'
- abstract: "This paper presents our system for the LT-EDI 2025 Shared Task on Racial\
    \ Hoax Detection, addressing the critical challenge of identifying racially charged\
    \ misinformation in code-mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish) social media\u2014a low-resource,\

    \ model. CharBERT was optimized using Optuna, while XLM-RoBERTa and DistilBERT\
    \ were fine-tuned for the classification task. FLAN-T5-base was fine-tuned with\
    \ SMOTE-based oversampling, semantic-preserving back translation, and prompt engineering,\
    \ whereas LLaMA was used solely for inference. Our preprocessing included Hinglish-specific\
    \ normalization, noise reduction, sentiment-aware corrections and a custom weighted\
    \ loss to emphasize the minority Hoax class. Despite using FLAN-T5-base due to\

  title: 'Hoax Terminators@LT-EDI 2025: CharBERT''s dominance over LLM Models in the
    Detection of Racial Hoaxes in Code-Mixed Hindi-English Social Media Data'
- abstract: 'Misogynistic content in memes on social me dia platforms poses a significant
    challenge for content moderation, particularly in languages like Chinese, where
    cultural nuances and multi modal elements complicate detection. Address ing this
    issue is critical for creating safer online environments, A shared task on multimodal
    misogyny identification in Chinese memes, or ganized by LT-EDI@LDK 2025, provided
    a curated dataset for this purpose. Since memes mix pictures and words, we used
    two smart tools: ResNet-50 to understand the images and Chinese RoBERTa to make
    sense of the text. The data set consisted of Chinese social media memes annotated
    with binary labels (Misogynistic and Non-Misogynistic), capturing explicit misogyny,
    implicit biases, and stereo types. Our experiments demonstrated that ResNet-50
    combined with Chinese RoBERTa achieved a macro F1 score of 0.91, placing second
    in the competition and underscoring its effectiveness in handling the complex
    interplay of text and visuals in Chinese memes. This research advances multimodal
    misogyny detection and contributes to natural language and vision processing for
    low-resource languages, particularly in combating gender-based abuse online.'

  title: 'CUET\_Ignite@LT-EDI-2025: A Multimodal Transformer-Based Approach for Detecting
    Misogynistic Memes in Chinese Social Media'
- abstract: The proliferation of caste- and migration-based hate speech on social
    media poses a significant challenge, particularly in low-resource languages like
    Tamil. This paper presents our approach to the LT-EDI@ACL 2025 shared task, addressing
    this issue through a hybrid transformer-based framework. We explore a range of
    Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and multilingual transformer models,
    culminating in a novel m-BERT+BiLSTM hybrid architecture. This model integrates
    contextual embeddings from m-BERT with lexical features from TF-IDF and FastText,
    feeding the enriched representations into a BiLSTM to capture bidirectional semantic
    dependencies. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of this hybrid architecture,
    achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.76 on the test set and surpassing the performance
    of standalone models such as MuRIL and IndicBERT. These results affirm the effectiveness
    of hybrid multilingual models for hate speech detection in low-resource and culturally
    complex linguistic settings.

  title: 'girlsteam@LT-EDI-2025: Caste/Migration based hate speech Detection'
- abstract: 'Detecting misogyny in memes is challenging due to their complex interplay
    of images and text that often disguise offensive content. Current AI models struggle
    with these cross-modal relationships and contain inherent biases. We tested multiple
    approaches for the Misogyny Meme Detection task at LT-EDI@LDK 2025: ChineseBERT,
    mBERT, and XLM-R for text; DenseNet, ResNet, and InceptionV3 for images. Our best-performing
    system fused fine-tuned ChineseBERT and DenseNet features, concatenating them
    before final classification through a fully connected network. This multimodal
    approach achieved a 0.93035 macro F1-score, winning 1st place in the competition
    and demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy for analyzing the subtle ways
    misogyny manifests in visual-textual content.'

  title: 'CUET\_320@LT-EDI-2025: A Multimodal Approach for Misogyny Meme Detection
    in Chinese Social Media'
- abstract: The performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems has improved
    significantly, driven by advancements in large-scale pre-trained models. However,
    adapting such models to low-resource languages such as Nepali is challenging due
    to the lack of labeled data and computational resources. Additionally, adapting
    the unique speech parameters of the speaker to a model is also a challenging task.
    Personalization helps to target the model to fit the particular speaker. This
    work investigates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank
    Adaptation (LoRA) and Decomposed Weight Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) to improve
    the performance of fine-tuned Whisper ASR models for Nepali ASR tasks by Personalization.
    These experiments demonstrate that the PEFT methods obtain competitive results
    while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to full
    fine-tuning. LoRA and DoRA show a relative WER to $FT_{Base}$ increment of 34.93\%
    and 36.79\%, respectively, and a relative CER to $FT_{Base}$ increment of 49.50\%
    and 50.03\%, respectively. Furthermore, the results highlight a 99.74\% reduction
    in total training parameters.

  title: Speech Personalization using Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning for Nepali Speakers
- abstract: The increasing prevalence of misogynistic content in online memes has
    raised concerns about their impact on digital discourse. The culture specific
    images and informal usage of text in the memes present considerable challenges
    for the automatic detection systems, especially in low-resource languages. While
    previous shared tasks have addressed misogyny detection in English and several
    European languages, misogynistic meme detection in the Chinese has remained largely
    unexplored. To address this gap, we introduced a shared task focused on binary
    classification of Chinese language memes as misogynistic or non-misogynistic.
    The task featured memes collected from the Chinese social media and annotated
    by native speakers. A total of 45 teams registered, with 8 teams submitting predictions
    from their multimodal models integrating textual and visual features through diverse
    fusion strategies. The best-performing system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.93035,
    highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight pretrained encoder fusion. This
    system used the Chinese BERT and DenseNet-121 for text and image feature extraction,
    respectively. A feedforward network was trained as a classifier using the features
    obtained by concatenating text and image features.

  title: Findings of the Shared Task Multilingual Bias and Propaganda Annotation in
    Political Discourse
- abstract: Hate speech targeting caste and migration communities is a growing concern
    in online platforms, particularly in linguistically diverse regions. By focusing
    on Tamil language text content, this task provides a unique opportunity to tackle
    caste or migration related hate speech detection in a low resource language Tamil,
    contributing to a safer digital space. We present the results and main findings
    of the shared task caste and migration hate speech detection. The task is a binary
    classification determining whether a text is caste/migration related hate speech
    or not. The task attracted 17 participating teams, experimenting with a wide range
    of methodologies from traditional machine learning to advanced multilingual transformers.
    The top performing system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.88105, enhancing an ensemble
    of fine-tuned transformer models including XLM-R and MuRIL. Our analysis highlights
    the effectiveness of multilingual transformers in low resource, ensemble learning,
    and culturally informed socio political context based techniques.

  title: Findings of the Shared Task Caste and Migration Hate Speech Detection
- abstract: The widespread use of social media has made it easier for false information
    to proliferate, particularly racially motivated hoaxes that can encourage violence
    and hatred. Such content is frequently shared in code-mixed languages in multilingual
    nations like India, which presents special difficulties for automated detection
    systems because of the casual language, erratic grammar, and rich cultural background.
    The shared task on detecting racial hoaxes in code mixed social media data aims
    to identify the racial hoaxes in Hindi-English data. It is a binary classification
    task with more than 5,000 labeled instances. A total of 11 teams participated
    in the task, and the results are evaluated using the macro-F1 score. The team
    that employed XLM-RoBERTa secured the first position in the task.

  title: Overview of the Shared Task on Detecting Racial Hoaxes in Code-Mixed Hindi-English
    Social Media Data
- abstract: 'The rise and the intensity of harassment and hate speech in social media
    platforms against LGBTQ+ communities is a growing concern. This work is an initiative
    to address this problem by conducting a shared task focused on the detection of
    homophobic and transphobic content in multilingual settings. The task comprises
    two subtasks: (1) multi-class classification of content into Homophobia, Transphobia,
    or Non-anti-LGBT+ categories across eight languages and (2) span-level detection
    to identify specific toxic segments within comments in English, Tamil, and Marathi.
    This initiative helps the development of explainable and socially re- sponsible
    AI tools for combating identity-based harm in digital spaces. Multiple teams registered
    for the task, however only two teams submitted their results, and the results
    were evaluated using the macro F1 score.'

  title: Overview of Homophobia and Transphobia Span Detection in Social Media Comments
- abstract: "In this paper, an overview of the shared task on speech recognition for\
    \ vulnerable individuals in Tamil (LT-EDI@LDK2025) is described. The work comes\
    \ with a Tamil dataset that was collected from elderly individuals who identify\
    \ as male, female, or transgender. The audio samples were taken in public places\
    \ such as markets, vegetable shops, hospitals, etc. The training phase and the\
    \ testing phase are when the dataset is made available. The task required of the\
    \ participants was to handle audio signals using various models and techniques\
    \ and then turn in their results as transcriptions of the provided test samples.\
    \ The participant\u2019s results were assessed using WER (Word Error Rate). The\
    \ transformer-based approach was used by participants to achieve automatic voice\
    \ recognition. This overview paper discusses the findings and various pre-trained\
    \ transformer-based models that the participants employed."
